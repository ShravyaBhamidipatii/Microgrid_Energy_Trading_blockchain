1. DEPLOY
2. registerMicrogrid
Use this function to register microgrids.

Field Name	Example Value
_energyCapacity	100 (kWh)
_energyPrice	2000000000000000 (wei = 0.002 ETH)
Steps in Remix:

Select the address of the microgrid (use accounts in Remix).
Input the above values.
Click on registerMicrogrid.
Repeat this with different addresses for multiple microgrids. Example:

Account 1: _energyCapacity = 100, _energyPrice = 2000000000000000
Account 2: _energyCapacity = 150, _energyPrice = 3000000000000000
3. listEnergyForSale
Microgrid owners list energy for sale.

Field Name	Example Value
_amount	50 (kWh)
Steps in Remix:

Use the same account that registered a microgrid.
Input 50 as _amount and call listEnergyForSale.
4. buyEnergy
Buyers purchase energy from registered microgrids.

Field Name	Example Value
_seller	Address of Seller
_amount	20 (kWh)
Payment (value):

totalPrice = _amount × energyPrice
Example:
If _seller has energyPrice = 2000000000000000 (0.002 ETH):
20 × 0.002 ETH = 0.04 ETH
Steps in Remix:

Use a buyer account (different from seller).
